# RogueCombat
A single player 2D game where the player may name, select, and switch characters to defeat enemies. The player can upgrade weapons as they slay their enemies and collect gold and experience to level-up their strength. The player must survive with 3 hearts to venture off to defeat the monsters that crawls all throughout the levels of the dungeon. If the player dies, the player must start over.
